# Image_Segmentation
Developed app using open-source models that segment objects from any data point and predict depth estimation within an image.

**Segmentation:**
1. Take an input image and user-defined points.
2. Use the SAM (Segment Anything Model) to generate segmentation masks for objects near those points.
3. Overlay those masks on the original image using a red color with transparency and display the final segmented image.
